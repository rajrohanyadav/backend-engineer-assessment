# Backend Engineer Assignment

**IMPORTANT: Do not send pull requests to this repository. This is a template repository and is not used for grading. Any pull requests will be closed and ignored.**

**Assignment status: I wasn't able to get the temporal to connect to the app running from `compose.yml` in time. Therefore, leaving that code as commented out.**

## Tasks:
- [x] Important: Fork the above repo
- [x] Stripe Integration for Customer Creation using Temporal Workflow
- [x] Add the following fields in the APIs
- [x] Add a new API to update fields in the API
- [ ] Add a Dockerfile - code commented out
- [x] API Implementation
- [ ] BONUS: Writing Tests - integrated but no tests could be completed
- [x] Code Walkthrough

To run the application, you'll need to use the same local method:
- Temporal cli running with `temporal server start-dev`
- Run app with `./gradlew bootRun`
- `api.http` can be used to test if needed.
- Redacting my stripe API Key ðŸ˜Š.
